            <h1>Chicken Vandaloo</h1>
            <p>
                Vandaloo is a popular Indian <a>curry dish</a> that calls for meat to be marinated 
                in a highlhy flavorful spicy mixture with vinegar, then quickly cooked up when 
                you're ready to eat.
            </p>
            <p>
                While this dish has a long list of spices, most are quite common in the average spice 
                rack. If you find you're missing one, it's not a deal breaker. You will still have a lovely,
                fragrant curry.
            </p>
